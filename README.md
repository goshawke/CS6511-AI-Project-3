Generalized Tic Tac Toe

A generalized Tic Tac Toe is an n*n board game where each player chooses one of the parts X or O, and then plays in an alternate order to place his choice on the board. A player wins when they are able to place m consecutive symbols (0s or Xs) in a contiguous sequence (row, column or diagonal). The game may end in a draw when no one wins.

Given Target (m) and Board Size (n), the agent can play against another agent in an n*n board and tries to place m parts in a row to win.

Using an API, we will play and record the games interactively with each other. Details of the API can be found here --> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1apI8JBF4FK8nm1xFmj0ud4O51VAJnjkiZxmbIeBqADE/edit#slide=id.g336e337eb8_0_278
